# Welcome to The Cloudsphere

[![PyPi version](https://badgen.net/pypi/v/tcsctl/)](https://pypi.org/project/tcsctl/)

The Cloudsphere efficiently manages your cloud infrastructures ðŸš€

Automate infrastructure as code (IaC) provisioning at any scale,
at any cloud or data center with any tool. Through a single central
API. Freely definable cloud infrastructures at the push of a button
as self-service.

## Getting started

Install the CLI for The Cloudsphere with ``pip3 install tcsctl``.

Prerequisite for the use is an account on our public service or on a
local on-premise installation.

Create the file ``tcs.yaml`` which contains the details of the API and
the authentication details.

```
# log_level: DEBUG
profiles:
  default:
    api_url: https://api.demo.thecloudsphere.io/api/
    api_version: v1
    insecure: false
    auth:
      username: client1@thecloudsphere.io
      password: password
```

To be sure, check that the configuration is valid.

```
tcsctl validate config tcs.yaml
Config tcs.yaml is valid.
```

Before you can use the CLI, you have to log in.

```
tcsctl login
Password:
Logged in successfully.
```

The list of visible projects allows you to check whether the login was
successful.

```
tcsctl project list
+----+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------+
|    | name                           | id                                   | created_at          |
|----+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------|
|  0 | client1@demo.thecloudsphere.io | 64ed6e39-0c05-42aa-a0ac-2267a7be5223 | 2023-01-30 16:18:22 |
+----+--------------------------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------+
```

Create the file ``sample.yaml`` which contains a sample template for a
deployment with Terraform on an OpenStack environment.

```
terraform-sample:
  environment:
    name: terraform/openstack
    repository: thecloudsphere/registry
    repository_server: https://github.com
  blueprint:
    name: terraform/openstack/minimal
    repository: thecloudsphere/registry
    repository_server: https://github.com
  blueprint_version: main
  inputs:
    prefix: terraform
    clouds.yaml:
      type: file
      path: clouds.yaml
    "cloud name": openstack
    flavor: "SCS-1V:1:10"
    "public network": public
```

To be sure, check that the template is valid.

```
tcsctl validate template sample.yaml
Template sample.yaml is valid.
```

This example uses a ``clouds.yaml`` file, which is located in the same directory
as the ``sample.yaml`` file. The content of this file depends very much on the
OpenStack environment used. Refer to the documentation of the operator of the
OpenStack environment accordingly.

Import the template ``terraform-sample`` defined in the previously created
``sample.yaml`` file.

```
tcsctl template import sample.yaml terraform-sample
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Field               | Value                                |
|---------------------+--------------------------------------|
| blueprint_id        | 803f3163-66b7-4c21-9c42-ef92fdb96fa6 |
| blueprint_version   | main                                 |
| environment_id      | d4135a7b-4eff-4e25-9f61-618b81b9a147 |
| environment_version |                                      |
| name                | terraform-sample                     |
| id                  | 05aa4b88-50ed-4dd1-8006-64772ae3f0f9 |
| created_at          | 2023-01-28 22:26:02                  |
+---------------------+--------------------------------------+
```

Blueprints and environments can be listed to verify the import.

```
tcsctl environment list --column name --column repository
+----+---------------------+-------------------------+
|    | name                | repository              |
|----+---------------------+-------------------------|
|  0 | terraform/openstack | thecloudsphere/registry |
+----+---------------------+-------------------------+
```

```
tcsctl blueprint list --column name --column repository
+----+-----------------------------+-------------------------+
|    | name                        | repository              |
|----+-----------------------------+-------------------------|
|  0 | terraform/openstack/minimal | thecloudsphere/registry |
+----+-----------------------------+-------------------------+
```

A deployment ``hello-world`` can now be created from the template
``terraform-sample``.

```
tcsctl deployment create hello-world terraform-sample
+-----------------+--------------------------------------+
| Field           | Value                                |
|-----------------+--------------------------------------|
| name            | hello-world                          |
| template_id     | 05aa4b88-50ed-4dd1-8006-64772ae3f0f9 |
| id              | 5fe18e39-1b5a-4d0e-8760-448b6cf2ab19 |
| created_at      | 2023-01-28 22:35:54                  |
| action          | CREATE                               |
| deployment_type | ENVIRONMENT                          |
| status          | NONE                                 |
+-----------------+--------------------------------------+
```

When the orchestrator selects the deployment for execution, the status is changed
from ``NONE`` to ``CREATE``.

```
tcsctl deployment list --column name --column status
+----+-------------+----------+
|    | name        | status   |
|----+-------------+----------|
|  0 | hello-world | CREATE   |
+----+-------------+----------+
```

Once the deployment has been created the status changes to ``CREATED``.

```
tcsctl deployment list --column name --column status
+----+-------------+----------+
|    | name        | status   |
|----+-------------+----------|
|  0 | hello-world | CREATED  |
+----+-------------+----------+
```

The public IP address and the SSH keypair for the login can then be retrieved via
the ``outputs`` command.

```
tcsctl deployment outputs hello-world address
10.100.3.41
```

```
tcsctl deployment outputs hello-world private_key
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEA1aiAph+QxP0dp18b04b24oE8+e4FFdxULeKiT4vZssuVRrFy
[...]
```

With ``tcsctl deployment outputs hello-world`` it is possible to output all
available outputs.

With the parameter ``--file``, the output can be written directly to a file.

```
tcsctl deployment outputs hello-world private_key --file id_rsa.hello-world
Output private_key from deployment hello-world was written to file id_rsa.hello-world.
```

There are blueprints that support a console, for example SSH, for control.
This console can be called up with the command ``tcsctl deployment control``.
The blueprints used in this Getting Started Guide support the control feature.
A deployment must be in status ``CREATED`` or ``RECONCILED`` for the control
feature to be usable.

```
tcsctl deployment control hello-world
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-52-generic x86_64)
[...]
ubuntu@hello-world-instance:~$
```

The logs that were printed during the creation of the deployment can
be displayed using the ``tcsctl deployments logs`` command.

```
tcsctl deployment logs --show hello-world create
data.openstack_networking_network_v2.public: Reading...
data.openstack_networking_network_v2.public: Read complete after 1s [id=665eea18-2b85-427c-b0bf-a6fd040cc0fc]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # local_sensitive_file.address will be created
[...]
```

All logs from a specific period for a deployment can also be displayed.

```
tcsctl deployment logs hello-world '15 minutes ago'

```

The ID of a log entry can be used to display a specific log entry.

```
tcsctl deployment logs hello-world b0765dac-2f1b-4d7b-84fc-85e328bfa018

[...]
```

If the deployment is no longer needed, it can be destroyed.

```
tcsctl deployment destroy hello-world
```

After a deployment has been destroyed, it can be deleted. All associated logs
are then also deleted.

```
tcsctl deployment delete hello-world
```

If you no longer need to use the CLI, you can log out.

```
tcsctl logout
Logged out successfully.
```

## Different Infrastructure-as-Code tool, same result

Previously, we created a simple environment with a blueprint for Terraform.
Here is a summary of the necessary commands

```
tcsctl template import sample.yaml terraform-sample
tcsctl deployment create hello-world terraform-sample
tcsctl deployment outputs hello-world address
tcsctl deployment outputs hello-world private_key
tcsctl deployment detroy hello-world
tcsctl deployment delete hello-world
```

The same result as in the previous example with the blueprint for Terraform
can also be produced with a different Infrastructure-as-Code tool For example
with Ansible. The following commands import a prepared blueprint for Ansible
and then create the same environment as before with Terraform.

```
tcsctl template import sample.yaml ansible-sample
tcsctl deployment create hello-ansible ansible-sample
tcsctl deployment outputs hello-ansible address
tcsctl deployment outputs hello-ansible private_key
tcsctl deployment detroy hello-ansible
tcsctl deployment delete hello-ansible
```
